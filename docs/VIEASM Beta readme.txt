As this is still the beta, there will be bugs. If you encouter any, please tell me. Also, the sounds will need to be at a reasonably high sample rate to sound normal, preferably 44100 Hz. Otherwise, enjoy. :)

Usage of asmcref.h:

This file holds the file names that correspond to your audio header file. By default they are set up for Wolfenstein only. You will need to modify both the sound and music tables, as well as the file paths, to suit your own needs. :)
